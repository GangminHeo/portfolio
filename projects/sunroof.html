                <h4>Project Type - Kinetic typography - Motion design</h4>
                <h4>Used Tool - After Effects / Illustrator</h4>
                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p> Kinetic typography is a type of motion design, creating an animation based on a text. It is used for
                    various purposes, but one thing that really got me into is a lyrics video. The fascinating flow of
                    motion graphics with the rhythm and groove of the song captivated me hard. And that is going to be
                    my direction to go.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I chose the song “Sunroof” by Nicky Your and dazy. It was one of my most-played songs this year. I
                    set my final goal of creating kinetic typography for a whole song but I had to change it to
                    highlight-only as the project went on. It was pretty challenging since I had to put a lot of time
                    and effort into teaching After Effects to myself as well as creating the motion graphic.
                    <br><br>
                    Starting the project, I did some research and set the plan. First, I did research on the song
                    (Sunroof) and tried to understand the overall mood and meaning of the song. The other parts of
                    research was basically just watching a lot of kinetic typography videos on youtube.
                    <br><br>
                    I could not build many ideation before I jump onto motion animation and see how they works myself
                    because it is quite hard to sketch those movements inside my head to paper or Illustrator artboard.
                    So I just jumped in After Effects. But last time I used After Effects was 2 years ago and I barely
                    remembered it. I had to go though tons of youtube videos, and online articles that covers from After
                    effects tutorial to some advanced skills.
                    <br><br>
                    I almost had nothing completed until mid-semester and all I did was watching a videos on youtube and
                    getting familiar with After Effects. But once I found a interesting technique, I tried to use them
                    in my project. Or sometimes I also came up with a motion idea but I had no clue how to implement
                    that in After effects, and I look up some skills and techniques that help me to bring my ideas to
                    motion graphic. So that is how I built most of my project.
