                <h4>Project Type - Motion design</h4>
                <h4>Used Tool - After Effects / premiere pro</h4>
                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>I was assigned to create a motion design package, MOGRT, for a event. I chose Worlds 2022 as my
                    event. Worlds 2022 is League of Legends 2022 Worlds Championship is the biggest worldwide LOL
                    competition. It is one of the most
                    enormous and noted Esports league where 24 best teams all around the world fight for the first
                    place. The
                    matches are held in several big stadiums in North America and there are many events such as opening
                    ceremony or player interview.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I set my direction for the MOGRT for broadcasting or highlight video of the matches. The design purpose is to give a contemporary and game-technological feeling as well as dynamic and sporty look since it is a kind of sports that
                    players do competition against each others and people support teams they like as fan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I planned to make a Intro/Outro card including logo reveal, Lower thirds and Transition.
                    <br><br>
                    After I created those assets in After effects, I exported them to premiere pro as mogrt fils and use them for showcasing video.
